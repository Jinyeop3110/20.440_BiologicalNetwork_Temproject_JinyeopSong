- Overview
This repo is to visualize scRNA data by generating various plots(FeatureScatter, Heatmap, LabelPoint, PCA_cluster, VlnPlot, etc..)

- Data
The data(GSE222510) is the mouse brain transcriptome by shifting aging signatures in multiple cell types. 
Total of 56 mouse brains with raw and processed data for 158,767 cells and filtered data for 50 mouse brains and 105,329 cells.

Since the original data is heavy, we reduced number of features and number of cells 

- Folder structure

At a high level, what is in each folder and subfolder?

- Installation
How do I run your code?
What software and package versions do I need to install?
